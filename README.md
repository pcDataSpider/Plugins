Plugins

Plugins are a great way to easily extend the existing functionality of the SpiderScope software. plugins are used to do things like plotting graphs, displaying information, keeping track of statistics, perform automated actions, and so much more. Plugins are written and python, and are simple to write. Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/pcDataSpider/plugins/wiki) for more information on installing and building you own plugins!
